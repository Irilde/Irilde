- 👋 Hi, I’m @Irilde aka Sajjad , aka AnonVenomous :)
- 👀 I’m interested in making games and perhaps making apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Unity game engine, but I do not want to stop there. Hopefully in the future, I can move things next level and start learning c++ and working on unreal engine. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any awesome game project.
- 📫 You can find me on Discord: SaJjAdKb13#2221  (the username is case sensitive)
